## Motivation
As a highly protective biological structure, the blood-brain barrier prevents the uncontrolled passage of
molecules to keep the central nervous system free from chemical toxification and maintain brain homeostasis.
Since most substances are not allowed to freely penetrate the blood-brain barrier, examination of the
bloodbrain barrier permeability (BBBP) of drug candidates is highly essential in drug discovery. To screen the
BBBP of molecules, several computational methods were developed with satisfactory outcomes. These
methods, however, have shortcomings that need to be addressed to improve prediction efficiency. In our study,
we propose iBBBP-EDL, an ensemble deep learning model that combines two types of neural networks: a
convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptrons, and three types of molecular representation
schemes: the Extended-Connectivity Fingerprint, RDKit molecular descriptors, and Mol2vec-embedded
features.

## Results
Experimental results confirmed the robustness and stability of our proposed model. Also, the benchmarking
analysis indicated that iBBBP-EDL outperformed all machine learning and deep learning baseline models with
a lower computational cost.
